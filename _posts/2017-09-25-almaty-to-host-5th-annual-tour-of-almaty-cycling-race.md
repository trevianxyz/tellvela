Kazakhstan's largest city Almaty has been hosting the "Tour of Almaty" cycling race every year since 2013. Since the inaugural competition in 2013, "Tour of Almaty" has become a globally recognized sporting event, in which most international professional cyclists look forward to participating.

This year, the annual racing event will be held from September 30 to October 1. It is the first time that "Tour of Almaty" has gained the status of a multi-day road cycling race, according to the regulations of the International Cycling Union (UCI). As [Kazpravda](http://www.kazpravda.kz/en/news/sports/almaty-2017-tour-cycling-race-will-take-two-days-and-finish-on-medeo/) reports, initially the racing event had the status of a one-day cycling category 1.2, which prevented professional teams from participating in it.

"Tour of Almaty" will consists of two parts: first part will go though the city of Almaty and the second one will include the beautiful mountainous terrain of the Almaty region.

According to the UCI rules, professional, pro-continental, continental, as well as national teams can take part in "Tour of Almaty", which has the status of the international professional road race. Kazakhstan's Astana Pro Team will traditionally take part in it. The cycling race will be aired on the Eurosport channel.
