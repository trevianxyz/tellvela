Astana's buildings have the volume dialed up to 11. They scream for your attention. They sway and dance; they shimmer and radiate. They are shaped like flying saucers, rugby balls, beer cans, dog bowls, tents, eggs. Traditional cultural symbols manage to coexist here, too. The image of the Samruk, a mythical bird of happiness that looks much like a golden eagle, is ubiquitous. Its symbolic "egg" (a 300-tonne ball of glass) is perched on top of the wacky Bayterek tower, a vanity project worthy of any Great Khan.
